# Who Am I?

That's a question with many layers, and I'm on a journey to peel them back one by one. Who am I? Well, there's who I aspire to be, how I see myself, and how others perceive me. My mission is to bridge the gap between these facets, to become the person I strive to be while constantly growing and improving.

**Husband and Father:** Above all, I'm a loving husband to Jennifer and a dedicated father to Nicholas and Kaitlyn. They are the heart of my world, and I aim to be their rock, their spiritual guide, and the dependable friend they can always count on. They inspire me to be better every day, showing me that actions speak louder than words.

**Technology Enthusiast:** In the realm of technology, I thrive on solving problems, whether they're technical or organizational in nature. It's the challenge that motivates me, the process of identifying what's possible and finding creative solutions. I'm energized when I'm learning something new and driven when facing what others might deem "too difficult" or "impossible."

**Passions and Priorities:** Beyond work and leadership, I'm an enthusiast with a wide range of passions. From mountain biking to deep-sea diving, scuba diving to mountain climbing, I've got a long list of thrilling experiences I'd like to embrace. But in this pursuit, there's a lesson in prioritizing what truly matters: family, faith, career, and the dream of building something more.

**Intentional Growth:** Growth is a constant in my life, both personally and professionally. I've learned that it's not just about setting goals but relishing the journey of growth itself. Whether it's through mentorships, books, articles, or experiences, I'm committed to the ongoing pursuit of learning and self-improvement.
